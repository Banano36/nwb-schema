=============
Release Notes
=============

Version: 1.0.0 and later
========================

Created seperate reStructuredText documentation to discuss and govern storage-related concerns.

Version: Before 1.0.0
=====================

Before version 1.0.0 there was no official seperate document governing NWB-N storage concerns as
HDF5 was the only supported storage backend with implicit mapping between HDF5 types and NWB-N
language primitives.
