Version 1.0.5g (and earlier) of the NWB file format and Version 1.1c (and earlier) of the specification language
were created by Jeff Teeters et al. as part of the first NWB pilot project. The documents governing the
specification language and format have been adopted from the final versions released by the original NWB pilot project.

Version 1.0.6a have been created by Oliver Ruebel and Andrew Tritt in collaboration with original members of the
NWB pilot project at the University of California in Berkeley and San Francisco and at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
