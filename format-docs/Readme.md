**Overview**

The NWB-N specification documentation uses Sphinx [http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)

**Generating the format documentation from the format spec**

The format documentation is auto-generated from the format specification (YAML/JSON) sources via:

```make apidoc```

This will invoke the script:

```python source/generate_format_docs.py```

The script automatically generates a series of .rst, .png, and .pdf files that are stored in the folder ```source/format_auto_docs```. The generated .rst files are included in ```source/format.rst``` and the png and pdf files are used as figures in the autogenerated docs. The folder ```source/format_auto_docs``` is reservered for autogenerated files, i.e., files in the folder should not be added or edited by hand as they will be deleted and rebuilt during the full built of the documentation.

**Building the documentation**

To build the documentation simply:

```make <doctype>```

where ```<doctype>``` is, e.g., ```latexpdf```, ```html```, ```singlehtml``` or ```man```. For a complete list of supported doc-types see:

```make help```

**Cleaning up**

By calling:

```make clean```

We remove all builds stored in ```_build``` as well as all autogenerated sources stored in ```source/format_auto_docs```.
