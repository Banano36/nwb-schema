  doc: Stores pixels in an image that represent different regions of interest (ROIs)
    or masks. All segmentation for a given imaging plane is stored together, with
    storage for multiple imaging planes (masks) supported. Each ROI is stored in its
    own subgroup, with the ROI group containing both a 2D mask and a list of pixels
    that make up this mask. Segments can also be used for masking neuropil. If segmentation
    is allowed to change with time, a new imaging plane (or module) is required and
    ROI names should remain consistent between them.
