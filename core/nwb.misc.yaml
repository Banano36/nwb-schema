  doc: Abstract features, such as quantitative descriptions of sensory stimuli. The
    TimeSeries::data field is a 2D array, storing those features (e.g., for visual
    grating stimulus this might be orientation, spatial frequency and contrast). Null
    stimuli (eg, uniform gray) can be marked as being an independent feature (eg,
    1.0 for gray, 0.0 for actual stimulus) or by storing NaNs for feature values,
    or through use of the TimeSeries::control fields. A set of features is considered
    to persist until the next set of features is defined. The final set of features
    stored should be the null set.

    field stores a text array, and timestamps are stored for each annotation (ie,

    array but that is identifiable as storing annotations in a machine-readable way.

  doc: Stores intervals of data. The timestamps field stores the beginning and end
    of intervals. The data field stores whether the interval just started (>0 value)
    or ended (<0 value). Different interval types can be represented in the same series
    by using multiple key values (eg, 1 for feature A, 2 for feature B, 3 for feature
    C, etc). The field data stores an 8-bit integer. This is largely an alias of a
    standard TimeSeries but that is identifiable as representing time intervals in
    a machine-readable way.
