  doc: Stores recorded voltage data from intracellular recordings when all current
    and amplifier settings are off (i.e., CurrentClampSeries fields will be zero).
    There is no CurrentClampStimulusSeries associated with an IZero series because
    the amplifier is disconnected and no stimulus can reach the cell.
