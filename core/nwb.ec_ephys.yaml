    mean waveforms, requiring a new interface or an extension of this one.

    FilteredEphys modules publish an ElectricalSeries for each filtered channel or
    set of channels. The name of each ElectricalSeries is arbitrary but should be
    informative. The source of the filtered data, whether this is from analysis of
    another time series or as acquired by hardware, should be noted in each's TimeSeries::description
    field. There is no assumed 1::1 correspondence between filtered ephys signals
    and electrodes, as a single signal can apply to many nearby electrodes, and one
    electrode may have different filtered (e.g., theta and/or gamma) signals represented.
