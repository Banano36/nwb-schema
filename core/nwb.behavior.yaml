    is a 2D array storing position or direction relative to some reference frame.
    Array structure: [num measurements] [num dimensions]. Each SpatialSeries has a
    text dataset reference_frame that indicates the zero-position, or the zero-axes
    for direction. For example, if representing gaze direction, "straight-ahead" might
    be a specific pixel on the monitor, or some other point in space. For position
    data, the 0,0 point might be the top-left corner of an enclosure, as viewed from
    the tracking camera. The unit of data will indicate how to interpret SpatialSeries
    values.'

    value: General container for storing behavorial epochs
  doc: TimeSeries for storing behavoioral epochs.  The objective of this and the other
    two Behavioral interfaces (e.g. BehavioralEvents and BehavioralTimeSeries) is
    to provide generic hooks for software tools/scripts. This allows a tool/script
    to take the output one specific interface (e.g., UnitTimes) and plot that data
    relative to another data modality (e.g., behavioral events) without having to
    define all possible modalities in advance. Declaring one of these interfaces means
    that one or more TimeSeries of the specified type is published. These TimeSeries
    should reside in a group having the same name as the interface. For example, if
    a BehavioralTimeSeries interface is declared, the module will have one or more
    TimeSeries defined in the module sub-group "BehavioralTimeSeries". BehavioralEpochs
    should use IntervalSeries. BehavioralEvents is used for irregular events. BehavioralTimeSeries
    is for continuous data.
