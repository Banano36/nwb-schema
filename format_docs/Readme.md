**Overview**

The NWB-N specification documentation uses Sphinx [http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)

**Rebuilding All**

To rebuild the full documentation in html, latex, and PDF simply run:

```make fulldoc```

This is a convenience function that is equivilant to:

```
make clean
make apidoc
make html
make latexpdf
```

**Generating the format documentation from the format spec**

The format documentation is auto-generated from the format specification (YAML/JSON) sources via:

```make apidoc```

This will invoke the script:

```python source/generate_format_docs.py```

The script automatically generates a series of .rst, .png, and .pdf files that are stored in the folder ```source/format_auto_docs```. The generated .rst files are included in ```source/format.rst``` and the png and pdf files are used as figures in the autogenerated docs. The folder ```source/format_auto_docs``` is reservered for autogenerated files, i.e., files in the folder should not be added or edited by hand as they will be deleted and rebuilt during the full built of the documentation.

**Building a specific document type**

To build the documentation simply:

```make <doctype>```

where ```<doctype>``` is, e.g., ```latexpdf```, ```html```, ```singlehtml``` or ```man```. For a complete list of supported doc-types see:

```make help```

**Cleaning up**

By calling:

```make clean```

We remove all builds stored in ```_build``` as well as all autogenerated sources stored in ```source/format_auto_docs```.

**Configuration**

The build of the documentation can be customized via a broad range of Sphinx options in:

```source/conf.py```

In addition to standard Sphinx options, there are a number of additional options used to customize the content and structure of the autogenerated documents, e.g.:

* ```spec_show_yaml_src``` Boolean indicating whether the YAML sources should be included for the different neurodata types
* ```spec_show_json_src``` Boolean indicating whether the JSON sources should be included for the different neurodata types
* ```spec_generate_src_file``` Boolen indicating whether the YAML/JSON sources of the neurodata_types should be rendered in a separate section (True) or in the same location as the main documentation
* ```spec_show_hierarchy_plots ``` Boolean indicating whether we should generate and show figures of the hierachy defined by the specifications as part of the documentation
* ```spec_file_per_type``` Boolean indicating whether we should generate separate .inc reStructuredText for each neurodata_type (True)
# or should all text be added to the main file
 = True
